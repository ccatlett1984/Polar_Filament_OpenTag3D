# Changelog

## 1.7.0
- **OpenTag3D 2.000 support, alongside 1.003.** The two layouts share only three addresses,
  so they are separate field tables behind a spec registry rather than one table with edits.
  2.000 is one flat 216-byte block against 1.003's Core-plus-Extended, adds `sku`, `barcode`,
  `nozzle_diameter` and `chamber_temp`, moves `tolerance` from micrometres to hundredths of a
  millimetre, and narrows `td` from two bytes to one. Verified field by field against
  opentag3d.info/spec.json and against a live pfil.us lookup
- **Reading needs no version.** A payload declares its own at `0x00`, so the field table is
  chosen from the bytes. This matters now rather than later: the Polar lookup service already
  serves 2.000, which 1.6.0 refused
- **A spec version selector** on both GUI screens, and `-SpecVersion` on
  `Export-OpenTag3DPayload`. **New tags default to 2.000** - the published spec, and what the
  lookup service serves; 1.003 stays a first-class choice. The lookup path keeps whatever the
  service returns unless a version is named, which is the lossless choice
- Saved images from the editor name the spec version they hold, both versions being in
  routine use. A profile with no recorded version is read as 1.003, since that is what its
  values were entered under
- **Conversion between versions**, matching fields by id and carrying values in real-world
  units, so `tolerance` converts rather than copies. Fields the target lacks, and values too
  wide for a narrower field, are dropped with a warning rather than mangled
- **NTAG213 is refused for 2.000** - 216 bytes plus framing against 144 bytes of user memory.
  The GUI removes the chip from the list while 2.000 is selected; the cmdlets explain why
- The editor groups 2.000's fields by the spec's own `usage` attribute (Display, Inventory,
  Operational), since 2.000 has no Core/Extended split
- Missing required fields are reported on save and write. 2.000 marks ten; 1.003 marks none
- Integer handling widened to 64-bit throughout - 2.000's `barcode` is 6 bytes and overflowed
  `Int32` in both directions
- Added `-PassThru` to `Export-OpenTag3DPayload`, returning the image bytes instead of writing
  a file. The GUI now uses it rather than saving to a temp file and rebuilding the name
- Profiles record the spec version they were saved from, and load into either

## 1.6.0
- Tags can be built by hand for any vendor, with no spool lookup: **New tag** on the
  View & edit screen opens a blank form covering every spec field, which then saves as an
  image or writes straight to a tag like any other payload. The serial is editable here -
  on a looked-up payload it stays locked, being the key the data came from - while the tag
  version stays fixed either way
- Field values can be saved as named **vendor profiles** and loaded back into a blank form,
  one JSON file each under `%APPDATA%\OpenTag3D\Profiles` or
  `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opentag3d/profiles`. Profile names are validated, and unknown keys are
  dropped on load, so an edited file cannot reach the encoder
- Colour fields now have a native colour picker beside the hex box, with a clear button to
  return a colour to unused. The hex box stays the value of record and alpha is preserved
- A blank form leaves unset numbers and times empty rather than showing 0 and 00:00:00
- Fields that fall outside the payload are no longer shown in the editor: a Core payload has
  nowhere to store them, and an editable box that silently discards what you type is worse
  than no box
- Saved image names now come from the edited values rather than the loaded ones, and fall
  back to manufacturer, material and colour when there is no serial

## 1.5.1
- Reader names differ between platforms - Windows reports `ACS ACR122U PICC Interface 0`,
  pcsc-lite reports `ACS ACR122U 00 00` - so `-ReaderName` no longer requires a literal
  substring match. A name that does not match exactly falls back to a per-word score, and
  the error now lists the readers seen and suggests a shorter fragment
- Tag identification is more robust on Linux:
  - `GET_VERSION` is tried through both PN532 wrappers, `InDataExchange` and
    `InCommunicateThru`. The Linux CCID driver frequently rejects the first
  - the NDEF capability container at page 3 is used as a second method - a plain read of a
    page every NTAG has
  - the page probe now runs smallest chip first and resets the card between attempts. A
    read past the end of memory makes the tag NAK, which wedges the card on pcsc-lite and
    made every later probe fail as well
  - the failure message lists what was tried and the status word each attempt returned
- Install instructions now cover the Linux and macOS module path
  (`~/.local/share/powershell/Modules`); `Unblock-File` is Windows-only and is skipped
  elsewhere

## 1.5.0
- Tag reading and writing now work on Linux and macOS through pcsc-lite, not Windows only.
  Three native bindings are declared, since the ABIs differ: Unicode entry points and 32-bit
  `DWORD` on Windows, ANSI entry points with LP64 `DWORD`/`LONG` on Linux, ANSI with 32-bit
  `DWORD` on macOS
- Reader availability is now probed rather than inferred from the operating system, so the
  GUI enables tag buttons whenever a reader is reachable
- PC/SC status codes are translated to readable messages (no reader, no tag, service down,
  polkit refusal) instead of bare hex

## 1.4.0
- Added `Read-OpenTag3DTag` — reads a tag or decodes a saved image into all 36 spec fields
- Added a **View & edit** screen to the GUI: load from a serial or a tag, edit any field,
  then save or write. Serial and tag version are display-only, enforced server-side
- NTAG213 truncation now warns and lists the fields that will be kept before writing
- GUI stops automatically when the page is closed (heartbeat, with `-IdleTimeout`/`-KeepAlive`)
- Output defaults to Downloads on Windows (resolved from the registry, so OneDrive
  redirection is respected) and the home directory elsewhere
- Fixed `Â` appearing before degree and micro signs: source files are now pure ASCII with a
  UTF-8 BOM, and JSON responses declare `charset=utf-8`
- Fixed `-shl` on `[byte]` truncating to byte width, which broke the tag version and any
  NDEF message over 254 bytes
- Fixed unit stripping on values whose unit contains digits (`600 g/10min`)

## 1.3.0
- Added the browser UI (`Show-OpenTag3DGui`), cross-platform via `HttpListener`

## 1.2.0
- Added NTAG213 support, forced to Core mode
- `-Mode` became optional with per-tag defaults
- All parameters are name-only

## 1.1.0
- Added `Write-OpenTag3DTag` — writes an image to a tag over PC/SC
- Chip type confirmed with `GET_VERSION` before writing; user memory verified after

## 1.0.0
- Initial module: `Export-OpenTag3DPayload`
